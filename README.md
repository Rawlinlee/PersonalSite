# Personal Site
http://www.rolandli.xyz

My own personal website! Originating from a base template, I gradually modified and personized the formatting and functionality using HTML/CSS, which I learned as I went!

Current To Do List (9/24/2016):
-Make portfolio tabable, or otherwise better allow condensed mult-project display
-Projects to the portfolio: Redshift, BINGO World Tour
